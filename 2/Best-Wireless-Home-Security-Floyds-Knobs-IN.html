<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy released by an item is referred to as its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of detecting tiny differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature distinctions. Since things are rarely exactly the same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
