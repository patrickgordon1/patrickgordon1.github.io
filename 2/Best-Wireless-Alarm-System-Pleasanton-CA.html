<p>In the evening, though it lacks the full IR LED variety of some rivals, the Arlo captures enough light to see a good distance, and there's an adjustable spotlight offered if you're positioning it outdoors - which nicely brings us to the great motion detection.

We got in touch with customer assistance, which offered a free replacement unit-- although the guarantee had long given that ended.</p>
