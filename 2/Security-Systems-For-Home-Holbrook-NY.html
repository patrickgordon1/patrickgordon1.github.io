<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
