<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against vandalism, fraud, and theft. Idea: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must again respond to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating unit.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered.
