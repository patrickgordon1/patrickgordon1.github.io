Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer depends upon a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you intend to store and how long you plan to keep taped video. The footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are lots of cameras shooting in a greater resolution. You can set a video recorder to "overwrite" the earliest video footage once you reach the system's capacity, but if you're not mindful, the system may overwrite archived video footage that you still need.</p>
