<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.

If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
