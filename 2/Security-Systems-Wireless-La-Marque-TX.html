Outdoor cameras need to be weather resistant and in many cases, completely water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most durable. Bullet cameras tend to be among the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their design allows for minimum glare. In regards to detection, it is much better to have a camera geared up with infrared detection rather than motion detection. Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by movement such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will supply more precise and less frequent alerts.</p>
