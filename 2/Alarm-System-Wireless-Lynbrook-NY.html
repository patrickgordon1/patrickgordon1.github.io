<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to capture intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a ineffective and pricey approach to robbery reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Three huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, mobility and impermanence. Tenants, unlike house owners, typically avoid making irreversible modifications to their homes.

Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can quickly be established at different residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too. Wireless security plans also enable remote control of the system and basic home automation.
