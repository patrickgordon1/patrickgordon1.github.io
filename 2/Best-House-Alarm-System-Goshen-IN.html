<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
