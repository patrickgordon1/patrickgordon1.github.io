As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
