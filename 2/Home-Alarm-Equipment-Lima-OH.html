The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by. Oddly, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
