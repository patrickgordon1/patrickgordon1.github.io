Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month.

IP cameras boast sharper, higher resolution images and more flexible features like remote zoom and repositioning. They also give you the option to view footage on a web internet browser.
