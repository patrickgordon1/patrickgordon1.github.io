<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than securing what you treasure most ... your household and home. The foundation of a home security system is the base station. This system is what communicates with all of the security sensing units and smart-home parts in your house. Many link to a home router, but if yours has Wi-Fi or cellular support, positioning is more flexible. When they open, contact sensing units are the first thing you need to buy along with the base station; these connect to doors and windows and will inform you.

On the plus side, purchasing your equipment upfront does give you the flexibility to move or cancel your system at any time.</p>

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
