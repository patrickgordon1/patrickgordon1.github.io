<p>The downside to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, suggesting that storms and strong winds have the power to disrupt the system and could even set off incorrect alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place frequently enough. Another possible disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool should be replaced or charged regularly in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can likewise be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally balanced out by the truth that there are no installation costs.</p>

In the worst case, all that would be required is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transmit video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
