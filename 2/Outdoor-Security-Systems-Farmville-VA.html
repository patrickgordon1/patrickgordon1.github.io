<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the patient's restroom. If a client is having trouble, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is usually open or normally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras consist of dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and signals, sensors, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized an approach of not only supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but incorporating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>
