With wise sensing units, you and your family pet can stay secured without fear of false alarms. It is much better to have a different computer system (server) for uploading video to the cloud.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For even more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though.
