<p>We love that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision option, but the black and white variation can actually be clearer and offer you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's cost and all its other features-- but for the record, stick to white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. However the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a photovoltaic panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas.

As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late since the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
