The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific person arrives at your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has broadened its security range with a fantastic outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a wise smoke detector and siren later on this year, that makes this an even much better proposition.</p>

<p>There's a couple of other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving items if it discovers an intruder; a helpful intercom function that allows the device to act as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hello doorbell ); and, because Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.
