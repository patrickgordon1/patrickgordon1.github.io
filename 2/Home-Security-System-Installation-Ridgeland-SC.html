<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
