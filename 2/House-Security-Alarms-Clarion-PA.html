Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
