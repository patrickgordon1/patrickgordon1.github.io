<p>ADT uses both wireless and hardwired security that is set up by a professional free of charge.

Naturally, you might want to think about buying a security camera or more to accompany your system, but opting for the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a little more costly than Frontpoint's most basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% marketing offer), which does not include a camera.</p>
