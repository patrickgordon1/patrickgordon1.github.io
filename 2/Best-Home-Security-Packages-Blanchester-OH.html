<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against scams, vandalism, and theft. Idea: Typically keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. We should again react to the alarm; each reaction is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms.

Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of clever things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.

<p>Many modern CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to reap some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup. DVRs transform the analog footage to digital, which assists to extend storage capability, makes it much easier to search archived video, and likewise allows users to stream video over a network for remote watching from several areas. Often, the mere existence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated intruders. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or harmed by the more identified robbers. They may also be less cautious about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
