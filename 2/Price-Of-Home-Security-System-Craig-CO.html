<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would occasionally downgrade the photo quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>

<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and for that reason provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>The Nest Camera IQ Outdoor streams 1080p video with the same membership model and same app as the original Nest Webcam Outdoor, however it includes more-detailed individual detection, a brighter image, an automated close-up tracking feature (which follows an individual around the seeing location), better audio, a more powerful install, and a larger operating temperature level variety (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit). It's also more tamper-proof than any of our other picks, but that added security makes for a more difficult installation process, and it costs nearly two times the price of the Nest Web Cam Outdoor.</p>
