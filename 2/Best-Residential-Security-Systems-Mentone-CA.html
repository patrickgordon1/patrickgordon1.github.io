<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident.
