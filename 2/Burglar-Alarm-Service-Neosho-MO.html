Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You need to play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets growl, felines scream, babies sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds.
