<p>We like that the Argus 2 comes with a color night vision choice, but the black and white variation can in fact be clearer and give you higher-quality footage. This isn't truly a huge deal considering the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick to white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service.

<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they do not stand apart too much. Pretty simple to install.

That separates it from the products I've currently composed, and assists in part to describe its cost.</p>
