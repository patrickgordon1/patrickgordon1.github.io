<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
