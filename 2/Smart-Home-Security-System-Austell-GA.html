<p>Alarm monitoring belongs to a complete home security system. It sounds an alarm within the home (typically incredibly high decibel so that you can hear it as can neighbors in some cases) and sounds an alarm with a professional monitoring company.

Then, the monitoring company immediately sets to action, connecting with you and informing the authorities.</p>
