<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make clients stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a substantial headache for customers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their newest software and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
