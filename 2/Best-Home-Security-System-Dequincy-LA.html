<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both human beings and animals.

<p>To gauge reaction times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of 5 times, using contact and motion sensors. However, keep in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security personnel. A number of cities also require an authorization to even own and operate a home security system. Rules such as these are developed to restrict the time and resources that authorities and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
