The Floodlight Security Camera from Swann perches on a corner of your home and does practically everything: from identifying the motion of trespassers to terrifying them away with a light and a siren. It's practically like an all-in-one security system, though it is course limited in terms of just how much of your residential or commercial property its single camera (with a 125-degree field of view) can cover.</p>
<p>Though the Arlo Ultra (see below) technically has all the same smarts and more in-depth 4K resolution, the Arlo Pro 3 still won our T3 Awards 2020 award for Best Smart Security , due to the fact that its image quality is still outstanding, and it's slightly much better worth - though its cost is still its achilles' heel. Still, what you get for the cash is all the typical Arlo traits in terms of the strong construct quality, outstanding camera video footage, tons of creative features and a sleek app.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
