<p>This nifty wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During screening, we discovered it was simple to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was identified. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's also worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps track of for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
