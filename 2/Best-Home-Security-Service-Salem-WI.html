<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's bathroom. If a patient is having trouble, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is an easy switch that is usually open or generally closed.

These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of the box. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually great. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
