The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building.

Must be a better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely suggest.</p>
