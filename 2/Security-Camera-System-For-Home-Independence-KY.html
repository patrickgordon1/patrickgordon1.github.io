It makes no sense that we do not have comparable laws for video recording. Wireless security systems use radio frequency (RF) or often Wi-Fi connections to link security sensors to the general system.

However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires verification from a private security guard. Several cities likewise require a license to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>

All of Frontpoint's equipment is meant for easy do-it-yourself (DIY) installation.
