The base station is curvier and the sensing units are smaller, however the range is better, appealing connections to wireless sensors as much as 800 feet away. We didn't go that far, but we had the ability to go about 40 feet in different instructions, through walls to areas in the cooking area and dining room.

Having a large number of noticeable CCTV cameras in public locations may serve as some level of deterrent, knowing you are being shot, though most likely not watched.</p>

The majority of our surveillance systems consist of DVR viewer software application for Mac and Windows PCs, as well as camera viewer apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android mobile devices. We sell lots of complete systems that are simple and pre-configured to install. Secure America uses both landline and wireless connection for monitoring.

The Do It Yourself installation procedure is relatively basic, though professional support is available over the phone.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
