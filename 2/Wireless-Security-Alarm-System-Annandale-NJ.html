<h3>Alarm System Companies Annandale NJ 08801</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, include complimentary storage, and use two AA batteries that can last as much as 2 years. However, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of in between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink doesn't offer you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker locations.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
