<p>While all plans feature the Frontpoint app, to open video surveillance and advanced clever tech functions, you'll require its $50-per-month Ultimate strategy. That's a high cost for home automation when compared to competitors like Vivint, which lets you add those features at every tier (starting at $40 monthly).

With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
