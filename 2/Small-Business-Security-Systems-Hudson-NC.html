Considered that the placement of these cameras is extremely crucial, the criminal activity patterns in locations of interest are generally studied for periods of time to determine criminal offense hotspots where cameras might potentially be placed.

<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid informs whenever you stroll by.
