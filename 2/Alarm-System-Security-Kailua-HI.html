The current Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is expensive, but it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision efficiency, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are validating with Arlo whether our system was malfunctioning, therefore we might revisit this evaluation. Essentially, the Nest camera sits any place you put it and records what it sees, saving the last five days of video footage to the cloud.
