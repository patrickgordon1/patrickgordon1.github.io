<p>The Google Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is the most technically advanced outdoor camera we have actually tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which automatically focuses on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom.
