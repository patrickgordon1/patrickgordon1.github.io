<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
