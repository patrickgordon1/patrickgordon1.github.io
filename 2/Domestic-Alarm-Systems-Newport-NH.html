Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
