You can even combine several cameras together on the app, if you so wish. Keep in mind that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The rest of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) But considering that a lot of retail theft wouldn't trip an alarm anyhow (a worker slipping some additional cash while giving a client change, for example), we think it's more crucial to have high-quality images so you have the evidence you need. Which's what Nest gives you.</p>
<p>Some systems might count on a keypad to get in gain access to codes to disarm an alarm and equip. Many modern home security systems may likewise offer phone apps or portable touchscreen control panels instead of keypads, which enable users more flexibility to manage the alarm system in addition to other components and clever home devices from different locations.
