<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides totally free perks like individual detection, familiar-face notifies, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked only about 50 percent of the camera and the time routinely disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when whatever else on our network appeared fine).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal given that the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
