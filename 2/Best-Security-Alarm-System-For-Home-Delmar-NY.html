<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood ought to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are extremely false and do not contribute substantially to police capability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed properties) a expensive and ineffective  approach to theft decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
