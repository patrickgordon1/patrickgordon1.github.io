<p>TP-Link's Kasa Cam Outdoor (KC200) has 1080p images and a 130-degree field of view that could measure up to some of our top picks. It likewise features two days of free cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can pack in clips of approximately 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings cut out in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensing units (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes.
