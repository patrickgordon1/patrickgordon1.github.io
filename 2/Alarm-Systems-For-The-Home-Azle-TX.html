<p>As a Contributing Editor for PCMag, John Delaney has actually been testing and examining displays, TVs, PCs, networking and clever home gear, and other assorted hardware and peripherals for nearly twenty years. A 13-year veteran of PC Magazine's Labs (most just recently as Director of Operations), John was responsible for the recruitment, training and management of the Labs technical staff, in addition to preserving the integrity and assessing of the Labs screening makers and procedures. Prior to signing up with Ziff Davis, John invested six years in retail operations for Federated Stores, Inc.  before accepting a buying position with Morris Decision Systems, one of New York's first value-added resellers of the original IBM PC.

We should keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
