If you want to watch on what's occurring in your house when you're not there, however you don't want to purchase a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera is worth a look.

Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment.

Just like most cameras, you'll get activity alerts with the Vivint Outdoor Camera Pro.</p>
<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is needed for transmitting video footage from the CCTV security cameras. This is one of the downsides of analog CCTV video surveillance, as the cable can be expensive and difficult to install, especially for larger camera networks, and those were cameras should be placed in difficult locations.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
