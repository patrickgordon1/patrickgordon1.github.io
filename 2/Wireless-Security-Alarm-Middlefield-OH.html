Another prospective disadvantage to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment should be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more costly than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is normally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>Canary has overcome some initial software problems to offer a very good security camera choice: especially that crisp 1080p video, with a 147-degree field of view, night vision and motion alerts (plus clear audio).

Ultimately, ADT's most significant benefit is brand name acknowledgment, making these systems a strong deterrent for prospective criminal activity.</p>
