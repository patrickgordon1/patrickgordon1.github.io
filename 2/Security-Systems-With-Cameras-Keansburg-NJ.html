<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
