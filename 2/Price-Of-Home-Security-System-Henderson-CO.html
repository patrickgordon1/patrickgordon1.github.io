Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.

<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image.
