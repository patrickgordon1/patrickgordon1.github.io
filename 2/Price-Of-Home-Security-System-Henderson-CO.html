Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs every time you walk by.

<p>Another crucial topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough. In this post, the term resolution" describes the number of dots (pixels) that make up a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about four times as much image information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. When it pertains to surveillance cameras, there are some challenging effects to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
