<p>Seeing angle: The camera's field of vision identifies how much it can see. As you're most likely monitoring a single space, you want a wide viewing angle. A lot of present cameras fall in the 130-degree variety. These wide angles can sometimes trigger image distortion at the edges in the type of a fisheye impact, particularly when utilized in smaller sized spaces, but it's not like you're going to use a security to catch snapshots for your image album.</p>
<p>Frontpoint's outdoor cameras are the most affordable in terms of both equipment cost and monthly monitoring fees. They use infrared night vision, have adjustable settings, and live stream to the Frontpoint app. To get the most out of the camera, location it where it's most visible.
