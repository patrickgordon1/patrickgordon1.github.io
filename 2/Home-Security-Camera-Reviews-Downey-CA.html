<p>Honeywell's Do It Yourself security system depends on a device called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like gadget with a camera on top. It serves as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensing units and 3rd party-devices via Z-Wave and controlling them using the app or voice control. Another location where Arlo stands out is customer support. After long-lasting testing this camera considering that we initially made it a pick in 2016, we noticed that our Arlo Q started predicting a pink tint, which appears to be an ongoing issue for some owners. We got in touch with customer support, which provided a complimentary replacement system-- although the warranty had long given that expired.</p>
