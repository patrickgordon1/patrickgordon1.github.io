This new Command system works with over 250 gadgets, provides robust file encryption to minimize hacking, geofencing, and more. Internal and external video cameras that store images in the Cloud.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices.

Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
