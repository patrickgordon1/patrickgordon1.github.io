This new Command system works with over 250 gadgets, provides robust file encryption to minimize hacking, geofencing, and more. Internal and external video cameras that store images in the Cloud.</p>
<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting. Given that this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to by hand stop alerts (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity issues, with 2 Hive test systems detaching eight times over two months. Scout is very simple to utilize, particularly if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it permits you to control nearly every element of the security system from another location, and it's highly adjustable.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
