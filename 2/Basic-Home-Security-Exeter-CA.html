<p>CR's take: The Wyze Web Cam V2 is a terrific security camera and an incredible value. It receives an Outstanding rating for video quality and is much easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 2 week of free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control via Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store video in your area on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not use paid membership plans for extra cloud storage.
