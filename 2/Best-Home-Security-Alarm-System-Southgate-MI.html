<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
