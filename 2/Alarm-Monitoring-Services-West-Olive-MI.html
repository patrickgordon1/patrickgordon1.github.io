<p>CR's take: The Wyze Camera V2 is a fantastic security camera and a phenomenal value. It receives an Outstanding ranking for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also does well in our personal privacy and security tests. The camera features a rolling 2 week of totally free storage for motion-trigged video clips, person detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the capability to store video locally on an SD card. Unlike the other cameras on this list, Wyze does not offer paid subscription plans for additional cloud storage. However the company does provide a Total Motion Capture service that continually records for as long as motion is discovered. Without the service or an SD card for local storage, the camera stops recording after 12 seconds.</p>
<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a satisfaction to use as well (a lot better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a learning curve. For all the more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though.
