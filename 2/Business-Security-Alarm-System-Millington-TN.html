<p>Good image and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand apart too much. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from far from the house. The second important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly shrill inbuilt alarm, so it functions as a home alarm system in addition to a security camera.
