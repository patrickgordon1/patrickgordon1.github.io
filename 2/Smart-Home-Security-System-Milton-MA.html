CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that chances to offend can be lowered by altering a variety of systems such as increasing the risk of a transgressor being nabbed, increasing the effort to devote the criminal activity, decreasing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that trigger criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
