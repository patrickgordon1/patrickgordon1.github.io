<h3>Security Camera System in Middletown NJ</h3>
<p>Unlike conventional burglar alarms, which have a control board (usually located in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensors have actually been set off, wise alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you've already left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been set off, rather than getting home to discover your siren has been sounding all afternoon (and possibly frustrating your neighbours).
