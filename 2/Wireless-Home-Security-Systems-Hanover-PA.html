We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year agreements!

<p>Nurse calling systems usually consist of emergency situation buttons or pull strings within the client's toilet. If a client is having problem, he can push the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a simple switch that is generally open or generally closed. Most of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to incorporate alarms and alerts, sensors, access control, and so on. My mind conceptualized a technique of not just supplying the client with the patient-monitoring system but integrating it into their old-fashioned nurse call station system.</p>

Frequently, the simple presence of security cameras can frighten less-motivated burglars. But keeping them hidden and out of sight can keep them from being tampered with or damaged by the more figured out burglars. They may also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks if intruders can not see any security cameras.</p>
