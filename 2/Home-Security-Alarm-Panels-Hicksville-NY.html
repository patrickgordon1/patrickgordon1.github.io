Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
