Typically, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is lots of readily available light, and as soon as the lighting ends up being low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to show. Due to the fact that they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adapt and capture outstanding low light video, commercial cameras outshine their cheaper cousins.</p>
