<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
