<p>When using IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, but not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cables to power the security camera independently, normally by means of 110VAC power.</p>

Making an upgrade from a hardwired system is normally an easy process, and it is frequently possible to bring all of your existing gadgets and sensing units to the new wireless system. If you have old hardwired devices, you can interface them with a wireless panel by adding a wired to wireless converter, such as the Honeywell 5800C2W.</p>
