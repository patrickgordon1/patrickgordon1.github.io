Here is what this indicates, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
