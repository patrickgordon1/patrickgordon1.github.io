<p>The loudest of the clever alarm systems we tested, the Somfy Home Alarm Video does a good job at warning anyone in your home and those neighboring that there's a problem. During testing, the siren was quick to sound when any of the sensing units were activated and we love that the level of sensitivity of the motion sensor can be adapted to represent family pets, too. The alarm system is simply one of two we evaluated that consists of an external siren, and we're pleased that it also features a dummy siren that can be attached to another external wall, even more discouraging anybody from attempting to break in to your property.
