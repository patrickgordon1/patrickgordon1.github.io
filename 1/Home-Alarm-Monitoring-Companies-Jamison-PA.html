Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
