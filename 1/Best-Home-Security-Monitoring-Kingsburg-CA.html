<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF certified, which indicates you can use a number of various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera deal with other ONVIF-compliant devices. Our company believe burglar alarms work best when incorporated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and gain access to control.
