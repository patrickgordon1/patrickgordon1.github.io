<h3>Security Alarms For Houses Destrehan LA 70047</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We've found that battery life never ever matches the manufacturer's stats considering that this originates from tests in a regulated environment without continuous video recording, which is the most significant culprit for short battery life without a doubt.
