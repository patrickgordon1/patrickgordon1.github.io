Wyze's just recently launched Complete Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly starts another, without any spaces in between.

Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by.
