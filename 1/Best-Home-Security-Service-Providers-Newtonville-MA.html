The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall.
