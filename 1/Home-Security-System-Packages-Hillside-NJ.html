The Wyze Web cam can also record video to the cloud, but the complimentary account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That implies the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to record once again, which suggests you might be missing a lot.

Selecting the ideal lens will permit your camera to focus and will bring enough light to the sensing unit on the camera, helping you to check out registration plates and recognise faces etc Besides the video proof and lower insurance coverage, you'll also save money if you buy and install cameras by yourself.
