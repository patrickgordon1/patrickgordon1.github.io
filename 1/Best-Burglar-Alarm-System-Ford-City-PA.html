<p>SimpliSafe may be too minimal for you if you have a larger home or residential or commercial property you want to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's currently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for keeping an eye on visitors and plan shipments, but it leaves other parts of your lawn susceptible. This system might not be the best fit if you have a large backyard or sheds to safeguard. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not need a base station-- it links straight to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo outdoor and indoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
