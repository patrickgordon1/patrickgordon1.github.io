<p>The motion detection is top notch, and the app is a pleasure to use too (a lot much better than the apps you get with some budget plan security cameras), though if you wish to get into its cleverest customisations, there is a little a knowing curve. For even more basic smarts, it's great, though. If you do not already have an Arlo camera or two in location, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can mean there are range issues.</p>
