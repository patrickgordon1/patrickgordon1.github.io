And with Vivint Playback you get 1 month of constant video recording, flexible viewing choices, and low-cost, high-capacity storage. Costly. The wired alarm is more expensive than a wireless alarm system. Every action of the process will cost money.

<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation triggered too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you need to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity concerns, with two Hive test units detaching 8 times over two months. Scout is extremely simple to utilize, specifically if you're a fan of mobile devices. The Scout mobile app works for iOS, Android, and web-based web browsers, and it enables you to control nearly every element of the security system remotely, and it's highly customizable. Inside the app, you can even control email subscriptions, SMS alerts, or the in-app alerts.</p>

As such, even if somebody breaks into your home in total darkness, you'll still have the ability to see them in your mobile phone app. The only problem here is that the taped video will be black and white and a little dark so you might not be able to see information clearly.</p>
