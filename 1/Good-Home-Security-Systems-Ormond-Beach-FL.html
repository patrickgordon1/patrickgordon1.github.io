<p>When compared to other companies we evaluated, Ring uses one of the most equipment alternatives. For example, where the majority of its competitors use one or two video doorbells, if any, Calling offers five. They were likewise the only ones to offer battery-powered and solar spotlights, cameras, and floodlights. Some of their cameras come with built-in lights and sirens also.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic.
