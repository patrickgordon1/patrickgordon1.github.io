<p>A camera with Wi-Fi can communicate with your home network wirelessly, which can be handy for installation. Due to the fact that it does not have wires that can be cut, it also makes your camera more tamper-proof. Sadly I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the very same camera. Boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clearness is truly terrific. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, however still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
