<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

<h3>Safe House Alarm System in Pacific Grove CA</h3>
<p>What's not to love about the Arlo Ultra? This camera takes cutting edge to new heights and comes with a ton of key features we haven't seen in a single video camera (or at all) previously.

<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers totally free perks like individual detection, familiar-face informs, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 each month.) Nevertheless, in our tests the familiar-face signals worked just about half of the camera and the time routinely detached from the network several times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine). The app was likewise painfully slow when we accessed live streams and tape-recorded clips, along with when we made changes in the settings.</p>
