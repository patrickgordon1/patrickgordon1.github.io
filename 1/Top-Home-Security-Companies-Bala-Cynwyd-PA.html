Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see in between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a big range in regards to the camera's vision cone. If you want to see a large area, you ought to think about a camera with a really broad field of view. The capability to mechanically pan and tilt the camera is a fantastic asset as well.</p>
<p>We love that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision alternative, but the black and white variation can really be clearer and offer you higher-quality video.
