<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment by doing this to make consumers stay with them longer, because changing monitoring companies indicates hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for clients. How did they do it? They positioned 5 routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their newest software application and firmware. According to the report, one device was hacked within a couple of minutes, while the rest were done and cleaned within a day. They didn't say which gadget was the very first, and the last to fall, however.</p>
