<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
