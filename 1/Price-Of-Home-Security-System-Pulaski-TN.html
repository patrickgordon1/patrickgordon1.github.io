<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes.
