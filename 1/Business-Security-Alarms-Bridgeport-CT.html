<p>In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover an entire space when put inside your home. It will cover a 5-tile radius if positioned on an outside wall. When a provider allows customers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring." Clients can monitor their homes with the assistance of motion detectors, sensors, and security cameras.

Most of the times, clients can also check the app to see live video footage from security cameras.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
