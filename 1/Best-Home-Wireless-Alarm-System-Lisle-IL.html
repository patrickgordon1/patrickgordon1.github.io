In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not lowered crime. "When the crime and offence figures were adapted to appraise the general downward pattern in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "reductions were noted in specific classifications but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had actually minimized criminal activity in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office also found that cameras did not cut criminal activity or the worry of criminal offense (as had a 2002 study, likewise for the British government).</p>
