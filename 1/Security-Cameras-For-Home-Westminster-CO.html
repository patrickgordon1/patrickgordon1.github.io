<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and minimize crime. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, however it pumps images up to 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we found the motion sensor to be touchy, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our system was faulty, and so we might revisit this review.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
