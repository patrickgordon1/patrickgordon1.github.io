<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it must be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
