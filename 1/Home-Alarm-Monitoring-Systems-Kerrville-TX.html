<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm system, a number of companies use "free monitoring services" for the very first couple of months.

For each additional camera, the membership is discounted to about half of the initial cost. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 monthly for individual detection with thirty days of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those features and bumps storage approximately 31 days.</p>
<p>Forget multi-year alarm monitoring agreements and service commitments. Go month to month or conserve 15% with an annual pre-pay.
