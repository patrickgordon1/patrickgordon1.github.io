The company that installed my alarm failed so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

<p>Our burglar alarms may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. As soon as the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the ability to acknowledge a violation. As soon as a zone has been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. As soon as the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and turning off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
