<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the patio by a certified electrical contractor (who happens to be my spouse). All of the cameras were linked to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>

The camera features a rolling 14 days of free storage for motion-trigged video, person detection, voice control by means of Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to save footage locally on an SD card.

It likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof because it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Sadly I purchased 4 cameras that look just like these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clarity is truly fantastic. Night vision is true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
