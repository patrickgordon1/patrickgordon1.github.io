<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. SimpliSafe responded with a declaration saying the system would alert users when it spotted any type of interference. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests utilizing 2 different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensors situated 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our testing should not be taken as definitive, we believe this problem is unlikely to be a real-world issue for SimpliSafe clients who own the present system.</p>

In spite of the substantial price here, there's no external monitoring alternative.</p>
