<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
