This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, however not suitable with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further electrical wiring. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power.</p>
