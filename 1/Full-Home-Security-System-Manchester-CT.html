Per the most recent data, the typical robbery in the United States lasts for about 90 seconds to 12 minutes and, typically, a burglar will get into a home within 60 seconds. 1 2 A lot of thefts target cash first followed by electronics, jewels, and drugs. 3 Typical security techniques include never hiding extra secrets outside, never ever turning off all the lights, applying small CCTV stickers on doors, and keeping good tabs with neighbours.</p>
