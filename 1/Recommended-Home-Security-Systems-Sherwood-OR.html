The Wyze Webcam can likewise catch video to the cloud, but the totally free account is limited to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That indicates the camera will wait 5 minutes prior to it's able to tape-record again, which indicates you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's just recently launched Total Motion Capture resolves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It allows recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and immediately starts another, without any gaps in between.
