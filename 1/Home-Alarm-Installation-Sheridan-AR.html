<h2>User Presence Inference Via Encrypted Traffic Of Wireless Camera In Sheridan</h2>
<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the dispute over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's often manipulated by factors such as skepticism over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause false alarms.

<p>This system employs an electro-magnetic field disturbance concept based upon two unshielded (or 'leaking') coaxial cables buried roughly 30 cm (1 feet) deep and 1 m (10 ft) apart. 6 The transmitter emits constant Radio Frequency (RF) energy along one cable and the energy is received by the other cable television. When the change in field strength weakens due to the presence of an item and reaches a pre-set lower threshold, an alarm condition is produced. The system is concealed after installation. Care should be taken to ensure the surrounding soil offers good drain in order to avoid annoyance alarms.</p>
