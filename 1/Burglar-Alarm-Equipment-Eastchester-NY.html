<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped housing that the camera sits in. Whilst these are fairly discreet CCTV cameras in look, this does not stop them from hindering bad guys. This is due to the fact that the dome housing makes it really challenging for people to see which direction the camera is pointing. This develops an air of uncertainty for potential thieves or vandals approaching from all instructions.

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
