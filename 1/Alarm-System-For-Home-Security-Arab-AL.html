<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>

If you do buy them, first inspect the suppliers return policy and 2nd keep the invoice.</p>
