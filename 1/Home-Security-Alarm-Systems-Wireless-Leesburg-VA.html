When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
