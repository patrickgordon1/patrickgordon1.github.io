<p>Three huge benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Renters, unlike homeowners, usually prevent making irreversible modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they include drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can quickly be established at various homes later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new elements too. Wireless security plans also enable remote control of the system and general home automation.
