<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
