<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.
