In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
