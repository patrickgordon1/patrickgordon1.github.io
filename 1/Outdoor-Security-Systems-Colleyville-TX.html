<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the duty of the entire neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived video footage you mean to keep and for how long you prepare to keep documented footage. The footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly if there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution.
