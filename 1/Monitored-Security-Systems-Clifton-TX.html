ADT is among the more expensive home security companies, with expensive video monitoring and steep early termination fees. However ADT is understood to offer deals that reduce the cost of equipment, that makes the overall cost for a 36-month agreement a lot more sensible.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially remarkable by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
