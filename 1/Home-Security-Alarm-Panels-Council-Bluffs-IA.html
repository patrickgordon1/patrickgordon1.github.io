<p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a user friendly outdoor Wi-Fi camera that's compact and can be utilized hardwired or entirely wirelessly-- the latter thanks to a removable, rechargeable battery that, based upon our screening, should offer a minimum of a couple of months of operation on a charge (depending upon use). The Arlo Pro 2 is also the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that uses 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a month-to-month fee ).
