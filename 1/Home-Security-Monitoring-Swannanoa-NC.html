We have actually found good deals here on SimpliSafe and Amcrest systems, but you'll discover more than 30 brands readily available. Often you don't have an option. High-end home security companies like Vivint and ADT offer only professional installation. But most other companies on our best home security systems list give you a Do It Yourself option. ADT does not have the strongest customer service credibility among the companies we considered, acquiring more than 3,000 grievances on its Bbb page While we chalked most of this as much as the truth that ADT has a number of million more customers than its competitors, our tester began his call with low expectations.</p>

Wired security systems are connected by hard-wired cables and require access to power outlets, making them more difficult to location and install. Wireless systems, on the other hand, utilize a WiFi connection, fast to set up, and can be put anywhere inside (or outside) your home.</p>

Both the initial Abode system and the House Iota work with Alexa, Google Assistant, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and more, but the Iota is the only model we tested that likewise deals with HomeKit.
