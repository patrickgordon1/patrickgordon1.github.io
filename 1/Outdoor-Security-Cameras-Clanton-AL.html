<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our screening-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We ought to keep in mind that the camera would occasionally downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day.
