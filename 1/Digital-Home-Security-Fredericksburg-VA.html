<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense avoidance developed to avoid both personal and residential or commercial property criminal offense and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing crime to other nearby areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>A system that needs an agreement might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why?

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the specific same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
