And that's what Nest offers you.</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA essentially uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

<p>Our alarm systems may be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an infraction. Once a zone has actually been violated, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and switching off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
