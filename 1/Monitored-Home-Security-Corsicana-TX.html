Well, it's a packaged security kit that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you select the complimentary self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>Another way to store recordings on a non-analogue media is through using a digital video recorder (DVR). Such a gadget is similar in functionality to a PC with a capture card and proper video recording software Unlike PCs, many DVRs developed for CCTV purposes are embedded devices that require less upkeep and easier setup than a PC-based option, for a medium to a large number of analogue cameras.

This journeys the alarm system and sets off the matching alarm. Closed-circuit systems are also tripped if the burglar cuts the power, as the circuit is broken.</p>
