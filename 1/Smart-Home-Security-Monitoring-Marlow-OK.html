<p>A lot of security cameras can be used both indoors and outdoors. They generally have the very same functions like night vision or remote viewing, but they vary in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras should be weather resistant and in many cases, totally water resistant. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather condition resistance ranking are the most long lasting.

This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
