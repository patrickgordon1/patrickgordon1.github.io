<p>I simply finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
