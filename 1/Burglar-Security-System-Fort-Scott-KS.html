<p>To evaluate response times for the monitoring company, we set off each system a minimum of five times, using contact and motion sensing units. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they respond at all.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
